        <label class='projectTitle'>Lead developer for myWorkplace to Jira ticketing system conversion. </label>
        - MyWorkplace was our old ticketing system for reporting features and bugs on our current software. The task was to port the data to Jira. I wrote the business logic to pull all the data from MyWorkplace in Cache Object Script, clean the fles with regex, and wrote the logic to map the fles data to Jira's internal ticketing system. Decreased upload time by 20% for entire process. Worked with all managers who used MyWorkplace.
